/**
 * Provides a Cloudflare Load Balancer resource. This sits in front of
 * a number of defined pools of origins and provides various options
 * for geographically-aware load balancing. Note that the load balancing
 * feature must be enabled in your Cloudflare account before you can use
 * this resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as cloudflare from "@pulumi/cloudflare";
 *
 * const exampleLoadBalancerPool = new cloudflare.LoadBalancerPool("example", {
 *     name: "example-lb-pool",
 *     origins: [{
 *         name: "example-1",
 *         address: "192.0.2.1",
 *         enabled: false,
 *     }],
 * });
 * // Define a load balancer which always points to a pool we define below.
 * // In normal usage, would have different pools set for different pops
 * // (cloudflare points-of-presence) and/or for different regions.
 * // Within each pop or region we can define multiple pools in failover order.
 * const example = new cloudflare.LoadBalancer("example", {
 *     zoneId: "0da42c8d2132a9ddaf714f9e7c920711",
 *     name: "example-load-balancer.example.com",
 *     fallbackPoolId: exampleLoadBalancerPool.id,
 *     defaultPoolIds: [exampleLoadBalancerPool.id],
 *     description: "example load balancer using geo-balancing",
 *     proxied: true,
 *     steeringPolicy: "geo",
 *     popPools: [{
 *         pop: "LAX",
 *         poolIds: [exampleLoadBalancerPool.id],
 *     }],
 *     countryPools: [{
 *         country: "US",
 *         poolIds: [exampleLoadBalancerPool.id],
 *     }],
 *     regionPools: [{
 *         region: "WNAM",
 *         poolIds: [exampleLoadBalancerPool.id],
 *     }],
 *     rules: [{
 *         name: "example rule",
 *         condition: "http.request.uri.path contains \"testing\"",
 *         fixedResponse: {
 *             messageBody: "hello",
 *             statusCode: 200,
 *             contentType: "html",
 *             location: "www.example.com",
 *         },
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import cloudflare:index/loadBalancer:LoadBalancer example <zone_id>/<load_balancer_id>
 * ```

    /**
     * The method the load balancer uses to determine the route to your origin. Value `off` uses `defaultPoolIds`. Value `geo` uses `popPools`/`countryPools`/`regionPools`. For non-proxied requests, the `country` for `countryPools` is determined by `locationStrategy`. Value `random` selects a pool randomly. Value `dynamicLatency` uses round trip time to select the closest pool in `defaultPoolIds` (requires pool health checks). Value `proximity` uses the pools' latitude and longitude to select the closest pool using the Cloudflare PoP location for proxied requests or the location determined by `locationStrategy` for non-proxied requests. Value `leastOutstandingRequests` selects a pool by taking into consideration `randomSteering` weights, as well as each pool's number of outstanding requests. Pools with more pending requests are weighted proportionately less relative to others. Value `leastConnections` selects a pool by taking into consideration `randomSteering` weights, as well as each pool's number of open connections. Pools with more open connections are weighted proportionately less relative to others. Supported for HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 connections. Value `""` maps to `geo` if you use `popPools`/`countryPools`/`regionPools` otherwise `off`. Available values: `off`, `geo`, `dynamicLatency`, `random`, `proximity`, `leastOutstandingRequests`, `leastConnections`, `""` Defaults to `""`.
