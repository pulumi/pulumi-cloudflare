     * object containing the following fields: 1. `inWaitingRoom`: Boolean indicating if the user is in the waiting room
     * (always **true**). 2. `waitTimeKnown`: Boolean indicating if the current estimated wait times are accurate. If
     * **false**, they are not available. 3. `waitTime`: Valid only when `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the
     * current estimated time in minutes the user will wait in the waiting room. When `queueingMethod` is **random**, this is
     * set to `waitTime50Percentile`. 4. `waitTime25Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and
     * `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 25% of users that gain
     * entry the fastest (25th percentile). 5. `waitTime50Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and
     * `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 50% of users that gain
     * entry the fastest (50th percentile). In other words, half of the queued users are expected to let into the origin
     * website before `waitTime50Percentile` and half are expected to be let in after it. 6. `waitTime75Percentile`: Valid only
     * when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum
     * wait time for the 75% of users that gain entry the fastest (75th percentile). 7. `waitTimeFormatted`: String displaying
     * the `waitTime` formatted in English for users. If `waitTimeKnown` is **false**, `waitTimeFormatted` will display
     * **unavailable**. 8. `queueIsFull`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room's queue is currently full and not accepting
     * new users at the moment. 9. `queueAll`: Boolean indicating if all users will be queued in the waiting room and no one
     * will be let into the origin website. 10. `lastUpdated`: String displaying the timestamp as an ISO 8601 string of the
     * user's last attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website. The user is able to make another
     * attempt after `refreshIntervalSeconds` past this time. If the user makes a request too soon, it will be ignored and
     * `lastUpdated` will not change. 11. `refreshIntervalSeconds`: Integer indicating the number of seconds after
     * `lastUpdated` until the user is able to make another attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin
     * website. When the `queueingMethod` is `reject`, there is no specified refresh time —\_it will always be **zero**. 12.
     * `queueingMethod`: The queueing method currently used by the waiting room. It is either **fifo**, **random**,
     * **passthrough**, or **reject**. 13. `isFIFOQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a FIFO
     * (First-In-First-Out) queue. 14. `isRandomQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a Random queue where users
     * gain access randomly. 15. `isPassthroughQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a passthrough queue. Keep in
     * mind that when passthrough is enabled, this JSON response will only exist when `queueAll` is **true** or
     * `isEventPrequeueing` is **true** because in all other cases requests will go directly to the origin. 16.
     * `isRejectQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a reject queue. 17. `isEventActive`: Boolean indicating if
     * an event is currently occurring. Events are able to change a waiting room's behavior during a specified period of time.
     * For additional information, look at the event properties `prequeueStartTime`, `eventStartTime`, and `eventEndTime` in
     * the documentation for creating waiting room events. Events are considered active between these start and end times, as
     * well as during the prequeueing period if it exists. 18. `isEventPrequeueing`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is
     * **true**. Boolean indicating if an event is currently prequeueing users before it starts. 19. `timeUntilEventStart`:
     * Valid only when `isEventPrequeueing` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event starts. 20.
     * `timeUntilEventStartFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventStart` formatted in English for users. If
     * `isEventPrequeueing` is **false**, `timeUntilEventStartFormatted` will display **unavailable**. 21. `timeUntilEventEnd`:
     * Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event ends. 22.
     * `timeUntilEventEndFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventEnd` formatted in English for users. If
     * `isEventActive` is **false**, `timeUntilEventEndFormatted` will display **unavailable**. 23. `shuffleAtEventStart`:
     * Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Boolean indicating if the users in the prequeue are shuffled randomly when
     * the event starts. 24. `turnstile`: Empty when turnstile isn't enabled. String displaying an html tag to display the
     * Turnstile widget. Please add the `{{{turnstile}}}` tag to the `customHtml` template to ensure the Turnstile widget
     * appears. 25. `infiniteQueue`: Boolean indicating whether the response is for a user in the infinite queue. An example
     * cURL to a waiting room could be: curl -X GET "https://example.com/waitingroom" \ -H "Accept: application/json" If
     * `jsonResponseEnabled` is **true** and the request hits the waiting room, an example JSON response when `queueingMethod`
     * is **fifo** and no event is active could be: { "cfWaitingRoom": { "inWaitingRoom": true, "waitTimeKnown": true,
     * "waitTime": 10, "waitTime25Percentile": 0, "waitTime50Percentile": 0, "waitTime75Percentile": 0, "waitTimeFormatted":

     * gain access randomly. 15. `isPassthroughQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a passthrough queue. Keep in
     * mind that when passthrough is enabled, this JSON response will only exist when `queueAll` is **true** or
     * `isEventPrequeueing` is **true** because in all other cases requests will go directly to the origin. 16.
     * `isRejectQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a reject queue. 17. `isEventActive`: Boolean indicating if
     * an event is currently occurring. Events are able to change a waiting room's behavior during a specified period of time.
     * For additional information, look at the event properties `prequeueStartTime`, `eventStartTime`, and `eventEndTime` in

     * Valid only when `isEventPrequeueing` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event starts. 20.
     * `timeUntilEventStartFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventStart` formatted in English for users. If

     * First-In-First-Out queue where customers gain access in the order they arrived. 2. `random`: Random queue where
     * customers gain access randomly, regardless of arrival time. 3. `passthrough`: Users will pass directly through the

     * enabled. This method can be used as an alternative to disabling a waiting room (with `suspended`) so that analytics are
     * still reported. This can be used if you wish to allow all traffic normally, but want to restrict traffic during a
     * waiting room event, or vice versa. 4. `reject`: Users will be immediately rejected from the waiting room. As a result,
     * no users will reach the origin website while this is enabled. This can be used if you wish to reject all traffic while
     * performing maintenance, block traffic during a specified period of time (an event), or block traffic while events are
     * not occurring. Consider a waiting room used for vaccine distribution that only allows traffic during sign-up events, and
     * otherwise blocks all traffic. For this case, the waiting room uses `reject`, and its events override this with `fifo`,
     * `random`, or `passthrough`. When this queueing method is enabled and neither `queueAll` is enabled nor an event is
