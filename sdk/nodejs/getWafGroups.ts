/**
 * Use this data source to look up [WAF Rule Groups](https://api.cloudflare.com/#waf-rule-groups-properties).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * The example below matches all WAF Rule Groups that contain the word `example` and are currently `on`. The matched WAF Rule Groups are then returned as output.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as cloudflare from "@pulumi/cloudflare";
 *
 * const test = cloudflare.getWafGroups({
 *     filter: {
 *         name: ".*example.*",
 *         mode: "on",
 *     },
 * });
 * export const wafGroups = test.then(test => test.groups);
 * ```
