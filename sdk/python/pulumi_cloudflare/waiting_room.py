        The set of arguments for constructing a WaitingRoom resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] host: The host name to which the waiting room will be applied (no wildcards). Please do not include the scheme (http:// or https://). The host and path combination must be unique.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] name: A unique name to identify the waiting room. Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores are allowed.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] new_users_per_minute: Sets the number of new users that will be let into the route every minute. This value is used as baseline for the number of users that are let in per minute. So it is possible that there is a little more or little less traffic coming to the route based on the traffic patterns at that time around the world.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] total_active_users: Sets the total number of active user sessions on the route at a point in time. A route is a combination of host and path on which a waiting room is available. This value is used as a baseline for the total number of active user sessions on the route. It is possible to have a situation where there are more or less active users sessions on the route based on the traffic patterns at that time around the world.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] zone_id: Identifier
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input['WaitingRoomAdditionalRouteArgs']]] additional_routes: Only available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. Additional hostname and path combinations to which this waiting room will be applied. There is an implied wildcard at the end of the path. The hostname and path combination must be unique to this and all other waiting rooms.
        :param pulumi.Input['WaitingRoomCookieAttributesArgs'] cookie_attributes: Configures cookie attributes for the waiting room cookie. This encrypted cookie stores a user's status in the waiting room, such as queue position.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] cookie_suffix: Appends a '_' + a custom suffix to the end of Cloudflare Waiting Room's cookie name(_*cf*waitingroom). If `cookie_suffix` is "abcd", the cookie name will be `__cf_waitingroom_abcd`. This field is required if using `additional_routes`.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] custom_page_html: Only available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. This is a template html file that will be rendered at the edge. If no custom*page*html is provided, the default waiting room will be used. The template is based on mustache ( https://mustache.github.io/ ). There are several variables that are evaluated by the Cloudflare edge:
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] default_template_language: The language of the default page template. If no default_template_language is provided, then `en-US` (English) will be
               used. Available values: "en-US", "es-ES", "de-DE", "fr-FR", "it-IT", "ja-JP", "ko-KR", "pt-BR", "zh-CN", "zh-TW",
               "nl-NL", "pl-PL", "id-ID", "tr-TR", "ar-EG", "ru-RU", "fa-IR", "bg-BG", "hr-HR", "cs-CZ", "da-DK", "fi-FI", "lt-LT",

               "uk-UA", "vi-VN".
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] description: A note that you can use to add more details about the waiting room.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] disable_session_renewal: Only available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. Disables automatic renewal of session cookies. If `true`, an
               accepted user will have session_duration minutes to browse the site. After that, they will have to go through the
               waiting room again. If `false`, a user's session cookie will be automatically renewed on every request.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[builtins.str]]] enabled_origin_commands: A list of enabled origin commands.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] json_response_enabled: Only available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. If `true`, requests to the waiting room with the header
               `Accept: application/json` will receive a JSON response object with information on the user's status in the waiting room
               as opposed to the configured static HTML page. This JSON response object has one property `cfWaitingRoom` which is an
               object containing the following fields: 1. `inWaitingRoom`: Boolean indicating if the user is in the waiting room
               (always **true**). 2. `waitTimeKnown`: Boolean indicating if the current estimated wait times are accurate. If
               **false**, they are not available. 3. `waitTime`: Valid only when `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the
               current estimated time in minutes the user will wait in the waiting room. When `queueingMethod` is **random**, this is
               set to `waitTime50Percentile`. 4. `waitTime25Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and
               `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 25% of users that gain
               entry the fastest (25th percentile). 5. `waitTime50Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and
               `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 50% of users that gain
               entry the fastest (50th percentile). In other words, half of the queued users are expected to let into the origin
               website before `waitTime50Percentile` and half are expected to be let in after it. 6. `waitTime75Percentile`: Valid only
               when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum
               wait time for the 75% of users that gain entry the fastest (75th percentile). 7. `waitTimeFormatted`: String displaying
               the `waitTime` formatted in English for users. If `waitTimeKnown` is **false**, `waitTimeFormatted` will display
               **unavailable**. 8. `queueIsFull`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room's queue is currently full and not accepting
               new users at the moment. 9. `queueAll`: Boolean indicating if all users will be queued in the waiting room and no one
               will be let into the origin website. 10. `lastUpdated`: String displaying the timestamp as an ISO 8601 string of the
               user's last attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website. The user is able to make another
               attempt after `refreshIntervalSeconds` past this time. If the user makes a request too soon, it will be ignored and
               `lastUpdated` will not change. 11. `refreshIntervalSeconds`: Integer indicating the number of seconds after
               `lastUpdated` until the user is able to make another attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin
               website. When the `queueingMethod` is `reject`, there is no specified refresh time — it will always be **zero**. 12.
               `queueingMethod`: The queueing method currently used by the waiting room. It is either **fifo**, **random**,
               **passthrough**, or **reject**. 13. `isFIFOQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a FIFO
               (First-In-First-Out) queue. 14. `isRandomQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a Random queue where users
               gain access randomly. 15. `isPassthroughQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a passthrough queue. Keep in
               mind that when passthrough is enabled, this JSON response will only exist when `queueAll` is **true** or
               `isEventPrequeueing` is **true** because in all other cases requests will go directly to the origin. 16.
               `isRejectQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a reject queue. 17. `isEventActive`: Boolean indicating if
               an event is currently occurring. Events are able to change a waiting room's behavior during a specified period of time.
               For additional information, look at the event properties `prequeue_start_time`, `event_start_time`, and `event_end_time`
               in the documentation for creating waiting room events. Events are considered active between these start and end times,
               as well as during the prequeueing period if it exists. 18. `isEventPrequeueing`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is
               **true**. Boolean indicating if an event is currently prequeueing users before it starts. 19. `timeUntilEventStart`:
               Valid only when `isEventPrequeueing` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event starts. 20.
               `timeUntilEventStartFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventStart` formatted in English for users. If
               `isEventPrequeueing` is **false**, `timeUntilEventStartFormatted` will display **unavailable**. 21. `timeUntilEventEnd`:
               Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event ends. 22.
               `timeUntilEventEndFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventEnd` formatted in English for users. If
               `isEventActive` is **false**, `timeUntilEventEndFormatted` will display **unavailable**. 23. `shuffleAtEventStart`:
               Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Boolean indicating if the users in the prequeue are shuffled randomly when
               the event starts. An example cURL to a waiting room could be: curl -X GET "https://example.com/waitingroom" \\ -H
               "Accept: application/json" If `json_response_enabled` is **true** and the request hits the waiting room, an example JSON
               response when `queueingMethod` is **fifo** and no event is active could be: { "cfWaitingRoom": { "inWaitingRoom": true,
               "waitTimeKnown": true, "waitTime": 10, "waitTime25Percentile": 0, "waitTime50Percentile": 0, "waitTime75Percentile": 0,
               "waitTimeFormatted": "10 minutes", "queueIsFull": false, "queueAll": false, "lastUpdated": "2020-08-03T23:46:00.000Z",
               "refreshIntervalSeconds": 20, "queueingMethod": "fifo", "isFIFOQueue": true, "isRandomQueue": false,
               "isPassthroughQueue": false, "isRejectQueue": false, "isEventActive": false, "isEventPrequeueing": false,
               "timeUntilEventStart": 0, "timeUntilEventStartFormatted": "unavailable", "timeUntilEventEnd": 0,
               "timeUntilEventEndFormatted": "unavailable", "shuffleAtEventStart": false } } If `json_response_enabled` is **true** and
               the request hits the waiting room, an example JSON response when `queueingMethod` is **random** and an event is active
               could be: { "cfWaitingRoom": { "inWaitingRoom": true, "waitTimeKnown": true, "waitTime": 10, "waitTime25Percentile": 5,
               "waitTime50Percentile": 10, "waitTime75Percentile": 15, "waitTimeFormatted": "5 minutes to 15 minutes", "queueIsFull":
               false, "queueAll": false, "lastUpdated": "2020-08-03T23:46:00.000Z", "refreshIntervalSeconds": 20, "queueingMethod":
               "random", "isFIFOQueue": false, "isRandomQueue": true, "isPassthroughQueue": false, "isRejectQueue": false,
               "isEventActive": true, "isEventPrequeueing": false, "timeUntilEventStart": 0, "timeUntilEventStartFormatted":
               "unavailable", "timeUntilEventEnd": 15, "timeUntilEventEndFormatted": "15 minutes", "shuffleAtEventStart": true } }.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] path: Sets the path within the host to enable the waiting room on. The waiting room will be enabled for all subpaths as well.
               If there are two waiting rooms on the same subpath, the waiting room for the most specific path will be chosen.
               Wildcards and query parameters are not supported.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] queue_all: If queue_all is `true`, all the traffic that is coming to a route will be sent to the waiting room. No new traffic can
               get to the route once this field is set and estimated time will become unavailable.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] queueing_method: Sets the queueing method used by the waiting room. Changing this parameter from the **default** queueing method is only
               available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. Regardless of the queueing method, if `queue_all` is enabled or an
               event is prequeueing, users in the waiting room will not be accepted to the origin. These users will always see a
               waiting room page that refreshes automatically. The valid queueing methods are: 1. `fifo` **(default)**:
               First-In-First-Out queue where customers gain access in the order they arrived. 2. `random`: Random queue where
               customers gain access randomly, regardless of arrival time. 3. `passthrough`: Users will pass directly through the
               waiting room and into the origin website. As a result, any configured limits will not be respected while this is
               enabled. This method can be used as an alternative to disabling a waiting room (with `suspended`) so that analytics are
               still reported. This can be used if you wish to allow all traffic normally, but want to restrict traffic during a
               waiting room event, or vice versa. 4. `reject`: Users will be immediately rejected from the waiting room. As a result,
               no users will reach the origin website while this is enabled. This can be used if you wish to reject all traffic while
               performing maintenance, block traffic during a specified period of time (an event), or block traffic while events are
               not occurring. Consider a waiting room used for vaccine distribution that only allows traffic during sign-up events, and
               otherwise blocks all traffic. For this case, the waiting room uses `reject`, and its events override this with `fifo`,
               `random`, or `passthrough`. When this queueing method is enabled and neither `queueAll` is enabled nor an event is
               prequeueing, the waiting room page **will not refresh automatically**. Available values: "fifo", "random",
               "passthrough", "reject".
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] queueing_status_code: HTTP status code returned to a user while in the queue. Available values: 200, 202, 429.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] session_duration: Lifetime of a cookie (in minutes) set by Cloudflare for users who get access to the route. If a user is not seen by
               Cloudflare again in that time period, they will be treated as a new user that visits the route.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] suspended: Suspends or allows traffic going to the waiting room. If set to `true`, the traffic will not go to the waiting room.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] turnstile_action: Which action to take when a bot is detected using Turnstile. `log` will have no impact on queueing behavior, simply
               keeping track of how many bots are detected in Waiting Room Analytics. `infinite_queue` will send bots to a false
               queueing state, where they will never reach your origin. `infinite_queue` requires Advanced Waiting Room. Available
               values: "log", "infinite_queue".
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] turnstile_mode: Which Turnstile widget type to use for detecting bot traffic. See [the Turnstile
               documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/concepts/widget/#widget-types) for the definitions of these
               widget types. Set to `off` to disable the Turnstile integration entirely. Setting this to anything other than `off` or
               `invisible` requires Advanced Waiting Room. Available values: "off", "invisible", "visible_non_interactive",
               "visible_managed".

        object containing the following fields: 1. `inWaitingRoom`: Boolean indicating if the user is in the waiting room
        (always **true**). 2. `waitTimeKnown`: Boolean indicating if the current estimated wait times are accurate. If
        **false**, they are not available. 3. `waitTime`: Valid only when `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the
        current estimated time in minutes the user will wait in the waiting room. When `queueingMethod` is **random**, this is
        set to `waitTime50Percentile`. 4. `waitTime25Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and
        `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 25% of users that gain
        entry the fastest (25th percentile). 5. `waitTime50Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and
        `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 50% of users that gain
        entry the fastest (50th percentile). In other words, half of the queued users are expected to let into the origin
        website before `waitTime50Percentile` and half are expected to be let in after it. 6. `waitTime75Percentile`: Valid only
        when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum
        wait time for the 75% of users that gain entry the fastest (75th percentile). 7. `waitTimeFormatted`: String displaying
        the `waitTime` formatted in English for users. If `waitTimeKnown` is **false**, `waitTimeFormatted` will display
        **unavailable**. 8. `queueIsFull`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room's queue is currently full and not accepting
        new users at the moment. 9. `queueAll`: Boolean indicating if all users will be queued in the waiting room and no one
        will be let into the origin website. 10. `lastUpdated`: String displaying the timestamp as an ISO 8601 string of the
        user's last attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website. The user is able to make another
        attempt after `refreshIntervalSeconds` past this time. If the user makes a request too soon, it will be ignored and
        `lastUpdated` will not change. 11. `refreshIntervalSeconds`: Integer indicating the number of seconds after
        `lastUpdated` until the user is able to make another attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin
        website. When the `queueingMethod` is `reject`, there is no specified refresh time — it will always be **zero**. 12.
        `queueingMethod`: The queueing method currently used by the waiting room. It is either **fifo**, **random**,
        **passthrough**, or **reject**. 13. `isFIFOQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a FIFO
        (First-In-First-Out) queue. 14. `isRandomQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a Random queue where users
        gain access randomly. 15. `isPassthroughQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a passthrough queue. Keep in
        mind that when passthrough is enabled, this JSON response will only exist when `queueAll` is **true** or
        `isEventPrequeueing` is **true** because in all other cases requests will go directly to the origin. 16.
        `isRejectQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a reject queue. 17. `isEventActive`: Boolean indicating if
        an event is currently occurring. Events are able to change a waiting room's behavior during a specified period of time.
        For additional information, look at the event properties `prequeue_start_time`, `event_start_time`, and `event_end_time`
        in the documentation for creating waiting room events. Events are considered active between these start and end times,
        as well as during the prequeueing period if it exists. 18. `isEventPrequeueing`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is
        **true**. Boolean indicating if an event is currently prequeueing users before it starts. 19. `timeUntilEventStart`:
        Valid only when `isEventPrequeueing` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event starts. 20.
        `timeUntilEventStartFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventStart` formatted in English for users. If
        `isEventPrequeueing` is **false**, `timeUntilEventStartFormatted` will display **unavailable**. 21. `timeUntilEventEnd`:
        Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event ends. 22.
        `timeUntilEventEndFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventEnd` formatted in English for users. If
        `isEventActive` is **false**, `timeUntilEventEndFormatted` will display **unavailable**. 23. `shuffleAtEventStart`:
        Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Boolean indicating if the users in the prequeue are shuffled randomly when
        the event starts. An example cURL to a waiting room could be: curl -X GET "https://example.com/waitingroom" \\ -H
        "Accept: application/json" If `json_response_enabled` is **true** and the request hits the waiting room, an example JSON
        response when `queueingMethod` is **fifo** and no event is active could be: { "cfWaitingRoom": { "inWaitingRoom": true,

        First-In-First-Out queue where customers gain access in the order they arrived. 2. `random`: Random queue where
        customers gain access randomly, regardless of arrival time. 3. `passthrough`: Users will pass directly through the

        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] description: A note that you can use to add more details about the waiting room.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] disable_session_renewal: Only available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. Disables automatic renewal of session cookies. If `true`, an
               accepted user will have session_duration minutes to browse the site. After that, they will have to go through the
               waiting room again. If `false`, a user's session cookie will be automatically renewed on every request.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[builtins.str]]] enabled_origin_commands: A list of enabled origin commands.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] host: The host name to which the waiting room will be applied (no wildcards). Please do not include the scheme (http:// or https://). The host and path combination must be unique.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] json_response_enabled: Only available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. If `true`, requests to the waiting room with the header
               `Accept: application/json` will receive a JSON response object with information on the user's status in the waiting room
               as opposed to the configured static HTML page. This JSON response object has one property `cfWaitingRoom` which is an
               object containing the following fields: 1. `inWaitingRoom`: Boolean indicating if the user is in the waiting room
               (always **true**). 2. `waitTimeKnown`: Boolean indicating if the current estimated wait times are accurate. If
               **false**, they are not available. 3. `waitTime`: Valid only when `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the
               current estimated time in minutes the user will wait in the waiting room. When `queueingMethod` is **random**, this is
               set to `waitTime50Percentile`. 4. `waitTime25Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and
               `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 25% of users that gain
               entry the fastest (25th percentile). 5. `waitTime50Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and
               `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 50% of users that gain
               entry the fastest (50th percentile). In other words, half of the queued users are expected to let into the origin
               website before `waitTime50Percentile` and half are expected to be let in after it. 6. `waitTime75Percentile`: Valid only
               when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum
               wait time for the 75% of users that gain entry the fastest (75th percentile). 7. `waitTimeFormatted`: String displaying
               the `waitTime` formatted in English for users. If `waitTimeKnown` is **false**, `waitTimeFormatted` will display
               **unavailable**. 8. `queueIsFull`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room's queue is currently full and not accepting
               new users at the moment. 9. `queueAll`: Boolean indicating if all users will be queued in the waiting room and no one
               will be let into the origin website. 10. `lastUpdated`: String displaying the timestamp as an ISO 8601 string of the
               user's last attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website. The user is able to make another
               attempt after `refreshIntervalSeconds` past this time. If the user makes a request too soon, it will be ignored and
               `lastUpdated` will not change. 11. `refreshIntervalSeconds`: Integer indicating the number of seconds after
               `lastUpdated` until the user is able to make another attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin
               website. When the `queueingMethod` is `reject`, there is no specified refresh time — it will always be **zero**. 12.
               `queueingMethod`: The queueing method currently used by the waiting room. It is either **fifo**, **random**,
               **passthrough**, or **reject**. 13. `isFIFOQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a FIFO
               (First-In-First-Out) queue. 14. `isRandomQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a Random queue where users
               gain access randomly. 15. `isPassthroughQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a passthrough queue. Keep in
               mind that when passthrough is enabled, this JSON response will only exist when `queueAll` is **true** or
               `isEventPrequeueing` is **true** because in all other cases requests will go directly to the origin. 16.
               `isRejectQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a reject queue. 17. `isEventActive`: Boolean indicating if
               an event is currently occurring. Events are able to change a waiting room's behavior during a specified period of time.
               For additional information, look at the event properties `prequeue_start_time`, `event_start_time`, and `event_end_time`
               in the documentation for creating waiting room events. Events are considered active between these start and end times,
               as well as during the prequeueing period if it exists. 18. `isEventPrequeueing`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is
               **true**. Boolean indicating if an event is currently prequeueing users before it starts. 19. `timeUntilEventStart`:
               Valid only when `isEventPrequeueing` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event starts. 20.
               `timeUntilEventStartFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventStart` formatted in English for users. If
               `isEventPrequeueing` is **false**, `timeUntilEventStartFormatted` will display **unavailable**. 21. `timeUntilEventEnd`:
               Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event ends. 22.
               `timeUntilEventEndFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventEnd` formatted in English for users. If
               `isEventActive` is **false**, `timeUntilEventEndFormatted` will display **unavailable**. 23. `shuffleAtEventStart`:
               Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Boolean indicating if the users in the prequeue are shuffled randomly when
               the event starts. An example cURL to a waiting room could be: curl -X GET "https://example.com/waitingroom" \\ -H
               "Accept: application/json" If `json_response_enabled` is **true** and the request hits the waiting room, an example JSON
               response when `queueingMethod` is **fifo** and no event is active could be: { "cfWaitingRoom": { "inWaitingRoom": true,
               "waitTimeKnown": true, "waitTime": 10, "waitTime25Percentile": 0, "waitTime50Percentile": 0, "waitTime75Percentile": 0,

               the request hits the waiting room, an example JSON response when `queueingMethod` is **random** and an event is active
               could be: { "cfWaitingRoom": { "inWaitingRoom": true, "waitTimeKnown": true, "waitTime": 10, "waitTime25Percentile": 5,

        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] name: A unique name to identify the waiting room. Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores are allowed.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] new_users_per_minute: Sets the number of new users that will be let into the route every minute. This value is used as baseline for the number of users that are let in per minute. So it is possible that there is a little more or little less traffic coming to the route based on the traffic patterns at that time around the world.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] next_event_prequeue_start_time: An ISO 8601 timestamp that marks when the next event will begin queueing.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] next_event_start_time: An ISO 8601 timestamp that marks when the next event will start.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] path: Sets the path within the host to enable the waiting room on. The waiting room will be enabled for all subpaths as well.
               If there are two waiting rooms on the same subpath, the waiting room for the most specific path will be chosen.
               Wildcards and query parameters are not supported.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] queue_all: If queue_all is `true`, all the traffic that is coming to a route will be sent to the waiting room. No new traffic can
               get to the route once this field is set and estimated time will become unavailable.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] queueing_method: Sets the queueing method used by the waiting room. Changing this parameter from the **default** queueing method is only
               available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. Regardless of the queueing method, if `queue_all` is enabled or an
               event is prequeueing, users in the waiting room will not be accepted to the origin. These users will always see a
               waiting room page that refreshes automatically. The valid queueing methods are: 1. `fifo` **(default)**:
               First-In-First-Out queue where customers gain access in the order they arrived. 2. `random`: Random queue where
               customers gain access randomly, regardless of arrival time. 3. `passthrough`: Users will pass directly through the
               waiting room and into the origin website. As a result, any configured limits will not be respected while this is
               enabled. This method can be used as an alternative to disabling a waiting room (with `suspended`) so that analytics are
               still reported. This can be used if you wish to allow all traffic normally, but want to restrict traffic during a
               waiting room event, or vice versa. 4. `reject`: Users will be immediately rejected from the waiting room. As a result,
               no users will reach the origin website while this is enabled. This can be used if you wish to reject all traffic while
               performing maintenance, block traffic during a specified period of time (an event), or block traffic while events are
               not occurring. Consider a waiting room used for vaccine distribution that only allows traffic during sign-up events, and
               otherwise blocks all traffic. For this case, the waiting room uses `reject`, and its events override this with `fifo`,
               `random`, or `passthrough`. When this queueing method is enabled and neither `queueAll` is enabled nor an event is
               prequeueing, the waiting room page **will not refresh automatically**. Available values: "fifo", "random",
               "passthrough", "reject".
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] queueing_status_code: HTTP status code returned to a user while in the queue. Available values: 200, 202, 429.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] session_duration: Lifetime of a cookie (in minutes) set by Cloudflare for users who get access to the route. If a user is not seen by
               Cloudflare again in that time period, they will be treated as a new user that visits the route.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] suspended: Suspends or allows traffic going to the waiting room. If set to `true`, the traffic will not go to the waiting room.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] total_active_users: Sets the total number of active user sessions on the route at a point in time. A route is a combination of host and path on which a waiting room is available. This value is used as a baseline for the total number of active user sessions on the route. It is possible to have a situation where there are more or less active users sessions on the route based on the traffic patterns at that time around the world.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] turnstile_action: Which action to take when a bot is detected using Turnstile. `log` will have no impact on queueing behavior, simply
               keeping track of how many bots are detected in Waiting Room Analytics. `infinite_queue` will send bots to a false
               queueing state, where they will never reach your origin. `infinite_queue` requires Advanced Waiting Room. Available
               values: "log", "infinite_queue".
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] turnstile_mode: Which Turnstile widget type to use for detecting bot traffic. See [the Turnstile
               documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/concepts/widget/#widget-types) for the definitions of these
               widget types. Set to `off` to disable the Turnstile integration entirely. Setting this to anything other than `off` or
               `invisible` requires Advanced Waiting Room. Available values: "off", "invisible", "visible_non_interactive",
               "visible_managed".

        `Accept: application/json` will receive a JSON response object with information on the user's status in the waiting room
        as opposed to the configured static HTML page. This JSON response object has one property `cfWaitingRoom` which is an
        object containing the following fields: 1. `inWaitingRoom`: Boolean indicating if the user is in the waiting room
        (always **true**). 2. `waitTimeKnown`: Boolean indicating if the current estimated wait times are accurate. If
        **false**, they are not available. 3. `waitTime`: Valid only when `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the
        current estimated time in minutes the user will wait in the waiting room. When `queueingMethod` is **random**, this is
        set to `waitTime50Percentile`. 4. `waitTime25Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and
        `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 25% of users that gain
        entry the fastest (25th percentile). 5. `waitTime50Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and
        `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 50% of users that gain
        entry the fastest (50th percentile). In other words, half of the queued users are expected to let into the origin
        website before `waitTime50Percentile` and half are expected to be let in after it. 6. `waitTime75Percentile`: Valid only
        when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum
        wait time for the 75% of users that gain entry the fastest (75th percentile). 7. `waitTimeFormatted`: String displaying
        the `waitTime` formatted in English for users. If `waitTimeKnown` is **false**, `waitTimeFormatted` will display
        **unavailable**. 8. `queueIsFull`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room's queue is currently full and not accepting
        new users at the moment. 9. `queueAll`: Boolean indicating if all users will be queued in the waiting room and no one
        will be let into the origin website. 10. `lastUpdated`: String displaying the timestamp as an ISO 8601 string of the
        user's last attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website. The user is able to make another
        attempt after `refreshIntervalSeconds` past this time. If the user makes a request too soon, it will be ignored and
        `lastUpdated` will not change. 11. `refreshIntervalSeconds`: Integer indicating the number of seconds after
        `lastUpdated` until the user is able to make another attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin
        website. When the `queueingMethod` is `reject`, there is no specified refresh time — it will always be **zero**. 12.
        `queueingMethod`: The queueing method currently used by the waiting room. It is either **fifo**, **random**,
        **passthrough**, or **reject**. 13. `isFIFOQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a FIFO
        (First-In-First-Out) queue. 14. `isRandomQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a Random queue where users
        gain access randomly. 15. `isPassthroughQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a passthrough queue. Keep in
        mind that when passthrough is enabled, this JSON response will only exist when `queueAll` is **true** or
        `isEventPrequeueing` is **true** because in all other cases requests will go directly to the origin. 16.
        `isRejectQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a reject queue. 17. `isEventActive`: Boolean indicating if
        an event is currently occurring. Events are able to change a waiting room's behavior during a specified period of time.
        For additional information, look at the event properties `prequeue_start_time`, `event_start_time`, and `event_end_time`
        in the documentation for creating waiting room events. Events are considered active between these start and end times,
        as well as during the prequeueing period if it exists. 18. `isEventPrequeueing`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is
        **true**. Boolean indicating if an event is currently prequeueing users before it starts. 19. `timeUntilEventStart`:
        Valid only when `isEventPrequeueing` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event starts. 20.
        `timeUntilEventStartFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventStart` formatted in English for users. If
        `isEventPrequeueing` is **false**, `timeUntilEventStartFormatted` will display **unavailable**. 21. `timeUntilEventEnd`:
        Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event ends. 22.
        `timeUntilEventEndFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventEnd` formatted in English for users. If
        `isEventActive` is **false**, `timeUntilEventEndFormatted` will display **unavailable**. 23. `shuffleAtEventStart`:
        Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Boolean indicating if the users in the prequeue are shuffled randomly when
        the event starts. An example cURL to a waiting room could be: curl -X GET "https://example.com/waitingroom" \\ -H
        "Accept: application/json" If `json_response_enabled` is **true** and the request hits the waiting room, an example JSON
        response when `queueingMethod` is **fifo** and no event is active could be: { "cfWaitingRoom": { "inWaitingRoom": true,
        "waitTimeKnown": true, "waitTime": 10, "waitTime25Percentile": 0, "waitTime50Percentile": 0, "waitTime75Percentile": 0,

        First-In-First-Out queue where customers gain access in the order they arrived. 2. `random`: Random queue where
        customers gain access randomly, regardless of arrival time. 3. `passthrough`: Users will pass directly through the

        :param pulumi.Input[Union['WaitingRoomCookieAttributesArgs', 'WaitingRoomCookieAttributesArgsDict']] cookie_attributes: Configures cookie attributes for the waiting room cookie. This encrypted cookie stores a user's status in the waiting room, such as queue position.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] cookie_suffix: Appends a '_' + a custom suffix to the end of Cloudflare Waiting Room's cookie name(_*cf*waitingroom). If `cookie_suffix` is "abcd", the cookie name will be `__cf_waitingroom_abcd`. This field is required if using `additional_routes`.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] custom_page_html: Only available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. This is a template html file that will be rendered at the edge. If no custom*page*html is provided, the default waiting room will be used. The template is based on mustache ( https://mustache.github.io/ ). There are several variables that are evaluated by the Cloudflare edge:
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] default_template_language: The language of the default page template. If no default_template_language is provided, then `en-US` (English) will be
               used. Available values: "en-US", "es-ES", "de-DE", "fr-FR", "it-IT", "ja-JP", "ko-KR", "pt-BR", "zh-CN", "zh-TW",
               "nl-NL", "pl-PL", "id-ID", "tr-TR", "ar-EG", "ru-RU", "fa-IR", "bg-BG", "hr-HR", "cs-CZ", "da-DK", "fi-FI", "lt-LT",

               "uk-UA", "vi-VN".
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] description: A note that you can use to add more details about the waiting room.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] disable_session_renewal: Only available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. Disables automatic renewal of session cookies. If `true`, an
               accepted user will have session_duration minutes to browse the site. After that, they will have to go through the
               waiting room again. If `false`, a user's session cookie will be automatically renewed on every request.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[builtins.str]]] enabled_origin_commands: A list of enabled origin commands.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] host: The host name to which the waiting room will be applied (no wildcards). Please do not include the scheme (http:// or https://). The host and path combination must be unique.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] json_response_enabled: Only available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. If `true`, requests to the waiting room with the header
               `Accept: application/json` will receive a JSON response object with information on the user's status in the waiting room
               as opposed to the configured static HTML page. This JSON response object has one property `cfWaitingRoom` which is an
               object containing the following fields: 1. `inWaitingRoom`: Boolean indicating if the user is in the waiting room
               (always **true**). 2. `waitTimeKnown`: Boolean indicating if the current estimated wait times are accurate. If
               **false**, they are not available. 3. `waitTime`: Valid only when `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the
               current estimated time in minutes the user will wait in the waiting room. When `queueingMethod` is **random**, this is
               set to `waitTime50Percentile`. 4. `waitTime25Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and
               `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 25% of users that gain
               entry the fastest (25th percentile). 5. `waitTime50Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and
               `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 50% of users that gain
               entry the fastest (50th percentile). In other words, half of the queued users are expected to let into the origin
               website before `waitTime50Percentile` and half are expected to be let in after it. 6. `waitTime75Percentile`: Valid only
               when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum
               wait time for the 75% of users that gain entry the fastest (75th percentile). 7. `waitTimeFormatted`: String displaying
               the `waitTime` formatted in English for users. If `waitTimeKnown` is **false**, `waitTimeFormatted` will display
               **unavailable**. 8. `queueIsFull`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room's queue is currently full and not accepting
               new users at the moment. 9. `queueAll`: Boolean indicating if all users will be queued in the waiting room and no one
               will be let into the origin website. 10. `lastUpdated`: String displaying the timestamp as an ISO 8601 string of the
               user's last attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website. The user is able to make another
               attempt after `refreshIntervalSeconds` past this time. If the user makes a request too soon, it will be ignored and
               `lastUpdated` will not change. 11. `refreshIntervalSeconds`: Integer indicating the number of seconds after
               `lastUpdated` until the user is able to make another attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin
               website. When the `queueingMethod` is `reject`, there is no specified refresh time — it will always be **zero**. 12.
               `queueingMethod`: The queueing method currently used by the waiting room. It is either **fifo**, **random**,
               **passthrough**, or **reject**. 13. `isFIFOQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a FIFO
               (First-In-First-Out) queue. 14. `isRandomQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a Random queue where users
               gain access randomly. 15. `isPassthroughQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a passthrough queue. Keep in
               mind that when passthrough is enabled, this JSON response will only exist when `queueAll` is **true** or
               `isEventPrequeueing` is **true** because in all other cases requests will go directly to the origin. 16.
               `isRejectQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a reject queue. 17. `isEventActive`: Boolean indicating if
               an event is currently occurring. Events are able to change a waiting room's behavior during a specified period of time.
               For additional information, look at the event properties `prequeue_start_time`, `event_start_time`, and `event_end_time`
               in the documentation for creating waiting room events. Events are considered active between these start and end times,
               as well as during the prequeueing period if it exists. 18. `isEventPrequeueing`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is
               **true**. Boolean indicating if an event is currently prequeueing users before it starts. 19. `timeUntilEventStart`:
               Valid only when `isEventPrequeueing` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event starts. 20.
               `timeUntilEventStartFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventStart` formatted in English for users. If
               `isEventPrequeueing` is **false**, `timeUntilEventStartFormatted` will display **unavailable**. 21. `timeUntilEventEnd`:
               Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event ends. 22.
               `timeUntilEventEndFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventEnd` formatted in English for users. If
               `isEventActive` is **false**, `timeUntilEventEndFormatted` will display **unavailable**. 23. `shuffleAtEventStart`:
               Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Boolean indicating if the users in the prequeue are shuffled randomly when
               the event starts. An example cURL to a waiting room could be: curl -X GET "https://example.com/waitingroom" \\ -H
               "Accept: application/json" If `json_response_enabled` is **true** and the request hits the waiting room, an example JSON
               response when `queueingMethod` is **fifo** and no event is active could be: { "cfWaitingRoom": { "inWaitingRoom": true,
               "waitTimeKnown": true, "waitTime": 10, "waitTime25Percentile": 0, "waitTime50Percentile": 0, "waitTime75Percentile": 0,
               "waitTimeFormatted": "10 minutes", "queueIsFull": false, "queueAll": false, "lastUpdated": "2020-08-03T23:46:00.000Z",
               "refreshIntervalSeconds": 20, "queueingMethod": "fifo", "isFIFOQueue": true, "isRandomQueue": false,
               "isPassthroughQueue": false, "isRejectQueue": false, "isEventActive": false, "isEventPrequeueing": false,
               "timeUntilEventStart": 0, "timeUntilEventStartFormatted": "unavailable", "timeUntilEventEnd": 0,
               "timeUntilEventEndFormatted": "unavailable", "shuffleAtEventStart": false } } If `json_response_enabled` is **true** and
               the request hits the waiting room, an example JSON response when `queueingMethod` is **random** and an event is active
               could be: { "cfWaitingRoom": { "inWaitingRoom": true, "waitTimeKnown": true, "waitTime": 10, "waitTime25Percentile": 5,
               "waitTime50Percentile": 10, "waitTime75Percentile": 15, "waitTimeFormatted": "5 minutes to 15 minutes", "queueIsFull":
               false, "queueAll": false, "lastUpdated": "2020-08-03T23:46:00.000Z", "refreshIntervalSeconds": 20, "queueingMethod":
               "random", "isFIFOQueue": false, "isRandomQueue": true, "isPassthroughQueue": false, "isRejectQueue": false,
               "isEventActive": true, "isEventPrequeueing": false, "timeUntilEventStart": 0, "timeUntilEventStartFormatted":
               "unavailable", "timeUntilEventEnd": 15, "timeUntilEventEndFormatted": "15 minutes", "shuffleAtEventStart": true } }.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] name: A unique name to identify the waiting room. Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores are allowed.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] new_users_per_minute: Sets the number of new users that will be let into the route every minute. This value is used as baseline for the number of users that are let in per minute. So it is possible that there is a little more or little less traffic coming to the route based on the traffic patterns at that time around the world.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] path: Sets the path within the host to enable the waiting room on. The waiting room will be enabled for all subpaths as well.
               If there are two waiting rooms on the same subpath, the waiting room for the most specific path will be chosen.
               Wildcards and query parameters are not supported.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] queue_all: If queue_all is `true`, all the traffic that is coming to a route will be sent to the waiting room. No new traffic can
               get to the route once this field is set and estimated time will become unavailable.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] queueing_method: Sets the queueing method used by the waiting room. Changing this parameter from the **default** queueing method is only
               available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. Regardless of the queueing method, if `queue_all` is enabled or an
               event is prequeueing, users in the waiting room will not be accepted to the origin. These users will always see a
               waiting room page that refreshes automatically. The valid queueing methods are: 1. `fifo` **(default)**:
               First-In-First-Out queue where customers gain access in the order they arrived. 2. `random`: Random queue where
               customers gain access randomly, regardless of arrival time. 3. `passthrough`: Users will pass directly through the
               waiting room and into the origin website. As a result, any configured limits will not be respected while this is
               enabled. This method can be used as an alternative to disabling a waiting room (with `suspended`) so that analytics are
               still reported. This can be used if you wish to allow all traffic normally, but want to restrict traffic during a
               waiting room event, or vice versa. 4. `reject`: Users will be immediately rejected from the waiting room. As a result,
               no users will reach the origin website while this is enabled. This can be used if you wish to reject all traffic while
               performing maintenance, block traffic during a specified period of time (an event), or block traffic while events are
               not occurring. Consider a waiting room used for vaccine distribution that only allows traffic during sign-up events, and
               otherwise blocks all traffic. For this case, the waiting room uses `reject`, and its events override this with `fifo`,
               `random`, or `passthrough`. When this queueing method is enabled and neither `queueAll` is enabled nor an event is
               prequeueing, the waiting room page **will not refresh automatically**. Available values: "fifo", "random",
               "passthrough", "reject".
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] queueing_status_code: HTTP status code returned to a user while in the queue. Available values: 200, 202, 429.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] session_duration: Lifetime of a cookie (in minutes) set by Cloudflare for users who get access to the route. If a user is not seen by
               Cloudflare again in that time period, they will be treated as a new user that visits the route.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] suspended: Suspends or allows traffic going to the waiting room. If set to `true`, the traffic will not go to the waiting room.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] total_active_users: Sets the total number of active user sessions on the route at a point in time. A route is a combination of host and path on which a waiting room is available. This value is used as a baseline for the total number of active user sessions on the route. It is possible to have a situation where there are more or less active users sessions on the route based on the traffic patterns at that time around the world.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] turnstile_action: Which action to take when a bot is detected using Turnstile. `log` will have no impact on queueing behavior, simply
               keeping track of how many bots are detected in Waiting Room Analytics. `infinite_queue` will send bots to a false
               queueing state, where they will never reach your origin. `infinite_queue` requires Advanced Waiting Room. Available
               values: "log", "infinite_queue".
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] turnstile_mode: Which Turnstile widget type to use for detecting bot traffic. See [the Turnstile
               documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/concepts/widget/#widget-types) for the definitions of these
               widget types. Set to `off` to disable the Turnstile integration entirely. Setting this to anything other than `off` or
               `invisible` requires Advanced Waiting Room. Available values: "off", "invisible", "visible_non_interactive",
               "visible_managed".

If no custom*page*html is provided, the default waiting room will be used. The template is based on mustache ( https://mustache.github.io/ ). There are several variables that are evaluated by the Cloudflare edge:

        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] description: A note that you can use to add more details about the waiting room.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] disable_session_renewal: Only available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. Disables automatic renewal of session cookies. If `true`, an
               accepted user will have session_duration minutes to browse the site. After that, they will have to go through the
               waiting room again. If `false`, a user's session cookie will be automatically renewed on every request.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[builtins.str]]] enabled_origin_commands: A list of enabled origin commands.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] host: The host name to which the waiting room will be applied (no wildcards). Please do not include the scheme (http:// or https://). The host and path combination must be unique.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] json_response_enabled: Only available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. If `true`, requests to the waiting room with the header
               `Accept: application/json` will receive a JSON response object with information on the user's status in the waiting room
               as opposed to the configured static HTML page. This JSON response object has one property `cfWaitingRoom` which is an
               object containing the following fields: 1. `inWaitingRoom`: Boolean indicating if the user is in the waiting room
               (always **true**). 2. `waitTimeKnown`: Boolean indicating if the current estimated wait times are accurate. If
               **false**, they are not available. 3. `waitTime`: Valid only when `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the
               current estimated time in minutes the user will wait in the waiting room. When `queueingMethod` is **random**, this is
               set to `waitTime50Percentile`. 4. `waitTime25Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and
               `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 25% of users that gain
               entry the fastest (25th percentile). 5. `waitTime50Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and
               `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 50% of users that gain
               entry the fastest (50th percentile). In other words, half of the queued users are expected to let into the origin
               website before `waitTime50Percentile` and half are expected to be let in after it. 6. `waitTime75Percentile`: Valid only
               when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum
               wait time for the 75% of users that gain entry the fastest (75th percentile). 7. `waitTimeFormatted`: String displaying
               the `waitTime` formatted in English for users. If `waitTimeKnown` is **false**, `waitTimeFormatted` will display
               **unavailable**. 8. `queueIsFull`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room's queue is currently full and not accepting
               new users at the moment. 9. `queueAll`: Boolean indicating if all users will be queued in the waiting room and no one
               will be let into the origin website. 10. `lastUpdated`: String displaying the timestamp as an ISO 8601 string of the
               user's last attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website. The user is able to make another
               attempt after `refreshIntervalSeconds` past this time. If the user makes a request too soon, it will be ignored and
               `lastUpdated` will not change. 11. `refreshIntervalSeconds`: Integer indicating the number of seconds after
               `lastUpdated` until the user is able to make another attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin
               website. When the `queueingMethod` is `reject`, there is no specified refresh time — it will always be **zero**. 12.
               `queueingMethod`: The queueing method currently used by the waiting room. It is either **fifo**, **random**,
               **passthrough**, or **reject**. 13. `isFIFOQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a FIFO
               (First-In-First-Out) queue. 14. `isRandomQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a Random queue where users
               gain access randomly. 15. `isPassthroughQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a passthrough queue. Keep in
               mind that when passthrough is enabled, this JSON response will only exist when `queueAll` is **true** or
               `isEventPrequeueing` is **true** because in all other cases requests will go directly to the origin. 16.
               `isRejectQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a reject queue. 17. `isEventActive`: Boolean indicating if
               an event is currently occurring. Events are able to change a waiting room's behavior during a specified period of time.
               For additional information, look at the event properties `prequeue_start_time`, `event_start_time`, and `event_end_time`
               in the documentation for creating waiting room events. Events are considered active between these start and end times,
               as well as during the prequeueing period if it exists. 18. `isEventPrequeueing`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is
               **true**. Boolean indicating if an event is currently prequeueing users before it starts. 19. `timeUntilEventStart`:
               Valid only when `isEventPrequeueing` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event starts. 20.
               `timeUntilEventStartFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventStart` formatted in English for users. If
               `isEventPrequeueing` is **false**, `timeUntilEventStartFormatted` will display **unavailable**. 21. `timeUntilEventEnd`:
               Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event ends. 22.
               `timeUntilEventEndFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventEnd` formatted in English for users. If
               `isEventActive` is **false**, `timeUntilEventEndFormatted` will display **unavailable**. 23. `shuffleAtEventStart`:
               Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Boolean indicating if the users in the prequeue are shuffled randomly when
               the event starts. An example cURL to a waiting room could be: curl -X GET "https://example.com/waitingroom" \\ -H
               "Accept: application/json" If `json_response_enabled` is **true** and the request hits the waiting room, an example JSON
               response when `queueingMethod` is **fifo** and no event is active could be: { "cfWaitingRoom": { "inWaitingRoom": true,
               "waitTimeKnown": true, "waitTime": 10, "waitTime25Percentile": 0, "waitTime50Percentile": 0, "waitTime75Percentile": 0,
               "waitTimeFormatted": "10 minutes", "queueIsFull": false, "queueAll": false, "lastUpdated": "2020-08-03T23:46:00.000Z",
               "refreshIntervalSeconds": 20, "queueingMethod": "fifo", "isFIFOQueue": true, "isRandomQueue": false,
               "isPassthroughQueue": false, "isRejectQueue": false, "isEventActive": false, "isEventPrequeueing": false,
               "timeUntilEventStart": 0, "timeUntilEventStartFormatted": "unavailable", "timeUntilEventEnd": 0,
               "timeUntilEventEndFormatted": "unavailable", "shuffleAtEventStart": false } } If `json_response_enabled` is **true** and
               the request hits the waiting room, an example JSON response when `queueingMethod` is **random** and an event is active
               could be: { "cfWaitingRoom": { "inWaitingRoom": true, "waitTimeKnown": true, "waitTime": 10, "waitTime25Percentile": 5,
               "waitTime50Percentile": 10, "waitTime75Percentile": 15, "waitTimeFormatted": "5 minutes to 15 minutes", "queueIsFull":
               false, "queueAll": false, "lastUpdated": "2020-08-03T23:46:00.000Z", "refreshIntervalSeconds": 20, "queueingMethod":
               "random", "isFIFOQueue": false, "isRandomQueue": true, "isPassthroughQueue": false, "isRejectQueue": false,
               "isEventActive": true, "isEventPrequeueing": false, "timeUntilEventStart": 0, "timeUntilEventStartFormatted":
               "unavailable", "timeUntilEventEnd": 15, "timeUntilEventEndFormatted": "15 minutes", "shuffleAtEventStart": true } }.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] name: A unique name to identify the waiting room. Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores are allowed.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] new_users_per_minute: Sets the number of new users that will be let into the route every minute. This value is used as baseline for the number of users that are let in per minute. So it is possible that there is a little more or little less traffic coming to the route based on the traffic patterns at that time around the world.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] next_event_prequeue_start_time: An ISO 8601 timestamp that marks when the next event will begin queueing.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] next_event_start_time: An ISO 8601 timestamp that marks when the next event will start.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] path: Sets the path within the host to enable the waiting room on. The waiting room will be enabled for all subpaths as well.
               If there are two waiting rooms on the same subpath, the waiting room for the most specific path will be chosen.
               Wildcards and query parameters are not supported.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] queue_all: If queue_all is `true`, all the traffic that is coming to a route will be sent to the waiting room. No new traffic can
               get to the route once this field is set and estimated time will become unavailable.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] queueing_method: Sets the queueing method used by the waiting room. Changing this parameter from the **default** queueing method is only
               available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. Regardless of the queueing method, if `queue_all` is enabled or an
               event is prequeueing, users in the waiting room will not be accepted to the origin. These users will always see a
               waiting room page that refreshes automatically. The valid queueing methods are: 1. `fifo` **(default)**:
               First-In-First-Out queue where customers gain access in the order they arrived. 2. `random`: Random queue where
               customers gain access randomly, regardless of arrival time. 3. `passthrough`: Users will pass directly through the
               waiting room and into the origin website. As a result, any configured limits will not be respected while this is
               enabled. This method can be used as an alternative to disabling a waiting room (with `suspended`) so that analytics are
               still reported. This can be used if you wish to allow all traffic normally, but want to restrict traffic during a
               waiting room event, or vice versa. 4. `reject`: Users will be immediately rejected from the waiting room. As a result,
               no users will reach the origin website while this is enabled. This can be used if you wish to reject all traffic while
               performing maintenance, block traffic during a specified period of time (an event), or block traffic while events are
               not occurring. Consider a waiting room used for vaccine distribution that only allows traffic during sign-up events, and
               otherwise blocks all traffic. For this case, the waiting room uses `reject`, and its events override this with `fifo`,
               `random`, or `passthrough`. When this queueing method is enabled and neither `queueAll` is enabled nor an event is
               prequeueing, the waiting room page **will not refresh automatically**. Available values: "fifo", "random",
               "passthrough", "reject".
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] queueing_status_code: HTTP status code returned to a user while in the queue. Available values: 200, 202, 429.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] session_duration: Lifetime of a cookie (in minutes) set by Cloudflare for users who get access to the route. If a user is not seen by
               Cloudflare again in that time period, they will be treated as a new user that visits the route.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] suspended: Suspends or allows traffic going to the waiting room. If set to `true`, the traffic will not go to the waiting room.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] total_active_users: Sets the total number of active user sessions on the route at a point in time. A route is a combination of host and path on which a waiting room is available. This value is used as a baseline for the total number of active user sessions on the route. It is possible to have a situation where there are more or less active users sessions on the route based on the traffic patterns at that time around the world.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] turnstile_action: Which action to take when a bot is detected using Turnstile. `log` will have no impact on queueing behavior, simply
               keeping track of how many bots are detected in Waiting Room Analytics. `infinite_queue` will send bots to a false
               queueing state, where they will never reach your origin. `infinite_queue` requires Advanced Waiting Room. Available
               values: "log", "infinite_queue".
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] turnstile_mode: Which Turnstile widget type to use for detecting bot traffic. See [the Turnstile
               documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/concepts/widget/#widget-types) for the definitions of these
               widget types. Set to `off` to disable the Turnstile integration entirely. Setting this to anything other than `off` or
               `invisible` requires Advanced Waiting Room. Available values: "off", "invisible", "visible_non_interactive",
               "visible_managed".

        `Accept: application/json` will receive a JSON response object with information on the user's status in the waiting room
        as opposed to the configured static HTML page. This JSON response object has one property `cfWaitingRoom` which is an
        object containing the following fields: 1. `inWaitingRoom`: Boolean indicating if the user is in the waiting room
        (always **true**). 2. `waitTimeKnown`: Boolean indicating if the current estimated wait times are accurate. If
        **false**, they are not available. 3. `waitTime`: Valid only when `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the
        current estimated time in minutes the user will wait in the waiting room. When `queueingMethod` is **random**, this is
        set to `waitTime50Percentile`. 4. `waitTime25Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and
        `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 25% of users that gain
        entry the fastest (25th percentile). 5. `waitTime50Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and
        `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 50% of users that gain
        entry the fastest (50th percentile). In other words, half of the queued users are expected to let into the origin
        website before `waitTime50Percentile` and half are expected to be let in after it. 6. `waitTime75Percentile`: Valid only
        when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum
        wait time for the 75% of users that gain entry the fastest (75th percentile). 7. `waitTimeFormatted`: String displaying
        the `waitTime` formatted in English for users. If `waitTimeKnown` is **false**, `waitTimeFormatted` will display
        **unavailable**. 8. `queueIsFull`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room's queue is currently full and not accepting
        new users at the moment. 9. `queueAll`: Boolean indicating if all users will be queued in the waiting room and no one
        will be let into the origin website. 10. `lastUpdated`: String displaying the timestamp as an ISO 8601 string of the
        user's last attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website. The user is able to make another
        attempt after `refreshIntervalSeconds` past this time. If the user makes a request too soon, it will be ignored and
        `lastUpdated` will not change. 11. `refreshIntervalSeconds`: Integer indicating the number of seconds after
        `lastUpdated` until the user is able to make another attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin
        website. When the `queueingMethod` is `reject`, there is no specified refresh time — it will always be **zero**. 12.
        `queueingMethod`: The queueing method currently used by the waiting room. It is either **fifo**, **random**,
        **passthrough**, or **reject**. 13. `isFIFOQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a FIFO
        (First-In-First-Out) queue. 14. `isRandomQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a Random queue where users
        gain access randomly. 15. `isPassthroughQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a passthrough queue. Keep in
        mind that when passthrough is enabled, this JSON response will only exist when `queueAll` is **true** or
        `isEventPrequeueing` is **true** because in all other cases requests will go directly to the origin. 16.
        `isRejectQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a reject queue. 17. `isEventActive`: Boolean indicating if
        an event is currently occurring. Events are able to change a waiting room's behavior during a specified period of time.
        For additional information, look at the event properties `prequeue_start_time`, `event_start_time`, and `event_end_time`
        in the documentation for creating waiting room events. Events are considered active between these start and end times,
        as well as during the prequeueing period if it exists. 18. `isEventPrequeueing`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is
        **true**. Boolean indicating if an event is currently prequeueing users before it starts. 19. `timeUntilEventStart`:
        Valid only when `isEventPrequeueing` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event starts. 20.
        `timeUntilEventStartFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventStart` formatted in English for users. If
        `isEventPrequeueing` is **false**, `timeUntilEventStartFormatted` will display **unavailable**. 21. `timeUntilEventEnd`:
        Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event ends. 22.
        `timeUntilEventEndFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventEnd` formatted in English for users. If
        `isEventActive` is **false**, `timeUntilEventEndFormatted` will display **unavailable**. 23. `shuffleAtEventStart`:
        Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Boolean indicating if the users in the prequeue are shuffled randomly when
        the event starts. An example cURL to a waiting room could be: curl -X GET "https://example.com/waitingroom" \\ -H
        "Accept: application/json" If `json_response_enabled` is **true** and the request hits the waiting room, an example JSON
        response when `queueingMethod` is **fifo** and no event is active could be: { "cfWaitingRoom": { "inWaitingRoom": true,

        event is prequeueing, users in the waiting room will not be accepted to the origin. These users will always see a
        waiting room page that refreshes automatically. The valid queueing methods are: 1. `fifo` **(default)**:
        First-In-First-Out queue where customers gain access in the order they arrived. 2. `random`: Random queue where
        customers gain access randomly, regardless of arrival time. 3. `passthrough`: Users will pass directly through the
