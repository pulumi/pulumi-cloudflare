        /// 1. `inWaitingRoom`: Boolean indicating if the user is in the waiting room (always **true**).
        /// 2. `waitTimeKnown`: Boolean indicating if the current estimated wait times are accurate. If **false**, they are not available.

        /// 4. `waitTime25Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 25% of users that gain entry the fastest (25th percentile).

Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 50% of users that gain entry the fastest (50th percentile). In other words, half of the queued users are expected to let into the origin website before `waitTime50Percentile` and half are expected to be let in after it.

        /// 9. `queueAll`: Boolean indicating if all users will be queued in the waiting room and no one will be let into the origin website.
        /// 10. `lastUpdated`: String displaying the timestamp as an ISO 8601 string of the user's last attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website.

When the `queueingMethod` is `Reject`, there is no specified refresh time â€”\_it will always be **zero**.
        /// 12. `queueingMethod`: The queueing method currently used by the waiting room. It is either **fifo**, **random**, **passthrough**, or **reject**.
        /// 13. `isFIFOQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue.
        /// 14. `isRandomQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a Random queue where users gain access randomly.
        /// 15. `isPassthroughQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a passthrough queue. Keep in mind that when passthrough is enabled, this JSON response will only exist when `queueAll` is **true** or `isEventPrequeueing` is **true** because in all other cases requests will go directly to the origin.
        /// 16. `isRejectQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a reject queue.
        /// 17. `isEventActive`: Boolean indicating if an event is currently occurring. Events are able to change a waiting room's behavior during a specified period of time. For additional information, look at the event properties `PrequeueStartTime`, `EventStartTime`, and `EventEndTime` in the documentation for creating waiting room events. Events are considered active between these start and end times, as well as during the prequeueing period if it exists.
        /// 18. `isEventPrequeueing`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Boolean indicating if an event is currently prequeueing users before it starts.
        /// 19. `timeUntilEventStart`: Valid only when `isEventPrequeueing` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event starts.
        /// 20. `timeUntilEventStartFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventStart` formatted in English for users. If `isEventPrequeueing` is **false**, `timeUntilEventStartFormatted` will display **unavailable**.
        /// 21. `timeUntilEventEnd`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event ends.
        /// 22. `timeUntilEventEndFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventEnd` formatted in English for users. If `isEventActive` is **false**, `timeUntilEventEndFormatted` will display **unavailable**.
        /// 23. `shuffleAtEventStart`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Boolean indicating if the users in the prequeue are shuffled randomly when the event starts.
        /// 24. `Turnstile`: Empty when turnstile isn't enabled. String displaying an html tag to display the Turnstile widget. Please add the `{{{turnstile}}}` tag to the `CustomHtml` template to ensure the Turnstile widget appears.

These users will always see a waiting room page that refreshes automatically. The valid queueing methods are:
        /// 1. `Fifo` **(default)**: First-In-First-Out queue where customers gain access in the order they arrived.
        /// 2. `Random`: Random queue where customers gain access randomly, regardless of arrival time.
        /// 3. `Passthrough`: Users will pass directly through the waiting room and into the origin website. As a result, any configured limits will not be respected while this is enabled. This method can be used as an alternative to disabling a waiting room (with `Suspended`) so that analytics are still reported. This can be used if you wish to allow all traffic normally, but want to restrict traffic during a waiting room event, or vice versa.
        /// 4. `Reject`: Users will be immediately rejected from the waiting room. As a result, no users will reach the origin website while this is enabled. This can be used if you wish to reject all traffic while performing maintenance, block traffic during a specified period of time (an event), or block traffic while events are not occurring. Consider a waiting room used for vaccine distribution that only allows traffic during sign-up events, and otherwise blocks all traffic. For this case, the waiting room uses `Reject`, and its events override this with `Fifo`, `Random`, or `Passthrough`. When this queueing method is enabled and neither `queueAll` is enabled nor an event is prequeueing, the waiting room page **will not refresh automatically**.
