Value `temporary` means traffic will be sent to another other healthy origin until the originally pinned origin is available; note that this can potentially result in heavy origin flapping. Value `sticky` means the session affinity cookie is updated and subsequent requests are sent to the new origin. This feature is currently incompatible with Argo, Tiered Cache, and Bandwidth Alliance.
