With value `cookie`, on the first request to a proxied load balancer, a cookie is generated, encoding information of which origin the request will be forwarded to. Subsequent requests, by the same client to the same load balancer, will be sent to the origin server the cookie encodes, for the duration of the cookie and as long as the origin server remains healthy. If the cookie has expired or the origin server is unhealthy then a new origin server is calculated and used. Value `ip_cookie` behaves the same as `cookie` except the initial origin selection is stable and based on the client's IP address. Available values: `""`, `none`, `cookie`, `ip_cookie`. Defaults to `none`.

        /// The method the load balancer uses to determine the route to your origin. Value `off` uses `default_pool_ids`. Value `geo` uses `pop_pools`/`country_pools`/`region_pools`. For non-proxied requests, the `country` for `country_pools` is determined by `location_strategy`. Value `random` selects a pool randomly. Value `dynamic_latency` uses round trip time to select the closest pool in `default_pool_ids` (requires pool health checks). Value `proximity` uses the pools' latitude and longitude to select the closest pool using the Cloudflare PoP location for proxied requests or the location determined by `location_strategy` for non-proxied requests. Value `least_outstanding_requests` selects a pool by taking into consideration `random_steering` weights, as well as each pool's number of outstanding requests. Pools with more pending requests are weighted proportionately less relative to others. Value `""` maps to `geo` if you use `pop_pools`/`country_pools`/`region_pools` otherwise `off`. Available values: `off`, `geo`, `dynamic_latency`, `random`, `proximity`, `least_outstanding_requests`, `""` Defaults to `""`.
