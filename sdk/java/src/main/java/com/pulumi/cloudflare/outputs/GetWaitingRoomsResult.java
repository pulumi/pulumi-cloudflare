If `true`, requests to the waiting room with the header `Accept: application/json` will receive a JSON response object with information on the user&#39;s status in the waiting room as opposed to the configured static HTML page. This JSON response object has one property `cfWaitingRoom` which is an object containing the following fields:
     * 1. `inWaitingRoom`: Boolean indicating if the user is in the waiting room (always **true**).
     * 2. `waitTimeKnown`: Boolean indicating if the current estimated wait times are accurate. If **false**, they are not available.
     * 3. `waitTime`: Valid only when `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated time in minutes the user will wait in the waiting room. When `queueingMethod` is **random**, this is set to `waitTime50Percentile`.
     * 4. `waitTime25Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 25% of users that gain entry the fastest (25th percentile).
     * 5. `waitTime50Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 50% of users that gain entry the fastest (50th percentile). In other words, half of the queued users are expected to let into the origin website before `waitTime50Percentile` and half are expected to be let in after it.
     * 6. `waitTime75Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 75% of users that gain entry the fastest (75th percentile).
     * 7. `waitTimeFormatted`: String displaying the `waitTime` formatted in English for users. If `waitTimeKnown` is **false**, `waitTimeFormatted` will display **unavailable**.
     * 8. `queueIsFull`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room&#39;s queue is currently full and not accepting new users at the moment.
     * 9. `queueAll`: Boolean indicating if all users will be queued in the waiting room and no one will be let into the origin website.
     * 10. `lastUpdated`: String displaying the timestamp as an ISO 8601 string of the user&#39;s last attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website. The user is able to make another attempt after `refreshIntervalSeconds` past this time. If the user makes a request too soon, it will be ignored and `lastUpdated` will not change.
     * 11. `refreshIntervalSeconds`: Integer indicating the number of seconds after `lastUpdated` until the user is able to make another attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website. When the `queueingMethod` is `reject`, there is no specified refresh time —\_it will always be **zero**.
     * 12. `queueingMethod`: The queueing method currently used by the waiting room. It is either **fifo**, **random**, **passthrough**, or **reject**.
     * 13. `isFIFOQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue.
     * 14. `isRandomQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a Random queue where users gain access randomly.
     * 15. `isPassthroughQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a passthrough queue. Keep in mind that when passthrough is enabled, this JSON response will only exist when `queueAll` is **true** or `isEventPrequeueing` is **true** because in all other cases requests will go directly to the origin.
     * 16. `isRejectQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a reject queue.
     * 17. `isEventActive`: Boolean indicating if an event is currently occurring. Events are able to change a waiting room&#39;s behavior during a specified period of time. For additional information, look at the event properties `prequeueStartTime`, `eventStartTime`, and `eventEndTime` in the documentation for creating waiting room events. Events are considered active between these start and end times, as well as during the prequeueing period if it exists.
     * 18. `isEventPrequeueing`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Boolean indicating if an event is currently prequeueing users before it starts.
     * 19. `timeUntilEventStart`: Valid only when `isEventPrequeueing` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event starts.
     * 20. `timeUntilEventStartFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventStart` formatted in English for users. If `isEventPrequeueing` is **false**, `timeUntilEventStartFormatted` will display **unavailable**.
     * 21. `timeUntilEventEnd`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event ends.
     * 22. `timeUntilEventEndFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventEnd` formatted in English for users. If `isEventActive` is **false**, `timeUntilEventEndFormatted` will display **unavailable**.
     * 23. `shuffleAtEventStart`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Boolean indicating if the users in the prequeue are shuffled randomly when the event starts.
     * 24. `turnstile`: Empty when turnstile isn&#39;t enabled. String displaying an html tag to display the Turnstile widget. Please add the `{{{turnstile}}}` tag to the `customHtml` template to ensure the Turnstile widget appears.
     * 25. `infiniteQueue`: Boolean indicating whether the response is for a user in the infinite queue.
     * 
     * An example cURL to a waiting room could be:
     * 
     *     curl -X GET &#34;https://example.com/waitingroom&#34; \

This method can be used as an alternative to disabling a waiting room (with `suspended`) so that analytics are still reported. This can be used if you wish to allow all traffic normally, but want to restrict traffic during a waiting room event, or vice versa.

Consider a waiting room used for vaccine distribution that only allows traffic during sign-up events, and otherwise blocks all traffic. For this case, the waiting room uses `reject`, and its events override this with `fifo`, `random`, or `passthrough`.

This JSON response object has one property `cfWaitingRoom` which is an object containing the following fields:
     * 1. `inWaitingRoom`: Boolean indicating if the user is in the waiting room (always **true**).
     * 2. `waitTimeKnown`: Boolean indicating if the current estimated wait times are accurate. If **false**, they are not available.
     * 3. `waitTime`: Valid only when `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated time in minutes the user will wait in the waiting room. When `queueingMethod` is **random**, this is set to `waitTime50Percentile`.
     * 4. `waitTime25Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 25% of users that gain entry the fastest (25th percentile).
     * 5. `waitTime50Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 50% of users that gain entry the fastest (50th percentile). In other words, half of the queued users are expected to let into the origin website before `waitTime50Percentile` and half are expected to be let in after it.
     * 6. `waitTime75Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 75% of users that gain entry the fastest (75th percentile).
     * 7. `waitTimeFormatted`: String displaying the `waitTime` formatted in English for users. If `waitTimeKnown` is **false**, `waitTimeFormatted` will display **unavailable**.
     * 8. `queueIsFull`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room&#39;s queue is currently full and not accepting new users at the moment.
     * 9. `queueAll`: Boolean indicating if all users will be queued in the waiting room and no one will be let into the origin website.
     * 10. `lastUpdated`: String displaying the timestamp as an ISO 8601 string of the user&#39;s last attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website. The user is able to make another attempt after `refreshIntervalSeconds` past this time. If the user makes a request too soon, it will be ignored and `lastUpdated` will not change.
     * 11. `refreshIntervalSeconds`: Integer indicating the number of seconds after `lastUpdated` until the user is able to make another attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website. When the `queueingMethod` is `reject`, there is no specified refresh time —\_it will always be **zero**.
     * 12. `queueingMethod`: The queueing method currently used by the waiting room. It is either **fifo**, **random**, **passthrough**, or **reject**.
     * 13. `isFIFOQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue.
     * 14. `isRandomQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a Random queue where users gain access randomly.
     * 15. `isPassthroughQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a passthrough queue. Keep in mind that when passthrough is enabled, this JSON response will only exist when `queueAll` is **true** or `isEventPrequeueing` is **true** because in all other cases requests will go directly to the origin.
     * 16. `isRejectQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a reject queue.
     * 17. `isEventActive`: Boolean indicating if an event is currently occurring. Events are able to change a waiting room&#39;s behavior during a specified period of time. For additional information, look at the event properties `prequeueStartTime`, `eventStartTime`, and `eventEndTime` in the documentation for creating waiting room events. Events are considered active between these start and end times, as well as during the prequeueing period if it exists.
     * 18. `isEventPrequeueing`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Boolean indicating if an event is currently prequeueing users before it starts.
     * 19. `timeUntilEventStart`: Valid only when `isEventPrequeueing` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event starts.
     * 20. `timeUntilEventStartFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventStart` formatted in English for users. If `isEventPrequeueing` is **false**, `timeUntilEventStartFormatted` will display **unavailable**.
     * 21. `timeUntilEventEnd`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event ends.
     * 22. `timeUntilEventEndFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventEnd` formatted in English for users. If `isEventActive` is **false**, `timeUntilEventEndFormatted` will display **unavailable**.
     * 23. `shuffleAtEventStart`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Boolean indicating if the users in the prequeue are shuffled randomly when the event starts.
     * 24. `turnstile`: Empty when turnstile isn&#39;t enabled. String displaying an html tag to display the Turnstile widget. Please add the `{{{turnstile}}}` tag to the `customHtml` template to ensure the Turnstile widget appears.
     * 25. `infiniteQueue`: Boolean indicating whether the response is for a user in the infinite queue.
     * 
     * An example cURL to a waiting room could be:
     * 
     *     curl -X GET &#34;https://example.com/waitingroom&#34; \

This can be used if you wish to allow all traffic normally, but want to restrict traffic during a waiting room event, or vice versa.
